# Lets make a list to play with:

names = ['Kenan', 'Bart', 'Patrick', 'Wouter', 'Olmo', 'Alex']

# Lets use a for loop to check if we have a name that starts with A, in most languages we do:

found = False
for name in names:
    if name.startswith('A'):
        print(name)
        found = True
        break  # If we do we use break[only interested in first name we find, for loops are resource expensive]

if not found:
    print('No name found starting with A')  # Triggered if no break is given by the time for loop ends

# Now lets see the Python way and see what it has in store for us:

for name in names:
    if name.startswith('X'):
        print(name)
        break
else:  # Else statement gets triggered if the for loop is not broken with the break keyword
    print('No name found starting with A')
