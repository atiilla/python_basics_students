# If you want double quotes in your string,
# it is possible:

message_1 = 'Python "programming'
print(message_1)

# Here we use double quotes to contain our value
# Then use an escape character to add a double quote in our string:

message_2 = "Python \"programming"
print(message_2)

# Other possible escape characters in Python are:

# \' displays a ' char
# \" displays a " char
# \\ displays a \ char
# \n inserts a new line
