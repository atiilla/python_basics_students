# Let's make 2 String variables to play with:

first = 'Alexander'
last = 'Keisse'

# And concatenate them together:

full = first + ' ' + last
print(full)

# Better practice would be using an expression,
# which is evaluated at runtime:

full_name = f'{first} {last}'
full_name_also_valid = F'{first} {last}'

print(full_name)
print(full_name_also_valid)

# Get the full powaaah:
fancy_char_counting = F'{"Name has:"} {len(full_name) - 1} {"chars."}'
print(fancy_char_counting)
