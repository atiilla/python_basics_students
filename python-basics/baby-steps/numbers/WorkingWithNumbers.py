# !Second part! has some useful methods, for complex mathematical computations
import math

# Lets declare a variable that represents a constant
# This does not exist in Python but our naming convention hints it[so that other programmers know]:

PI = 3.14

# We can round a number as follows:

print(round(PI))

# Lets make a negative variable:

NEG_PI = -3.14

# We can see it's absolute value as follows:

print(abs(NEG_PI))

# To see all the built in functions python go to:

# !SECOND PART OF DEMO!
print(math.floor(PI))  # Returns the floor number of PI as an Integral number
print(math.ceil(PI))  # Returns the ceiling number of PI as an Integral number
